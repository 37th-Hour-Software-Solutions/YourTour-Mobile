# Project Goal

This project is a Flutter frontend for the YourTour mobile application. 

YourTour is a navigation app that gamifies and educates users about their surroundings. Specifically, as users travel through different cities, they are given facts about the city and its history. There is a concept of "gems" that users can collect by visiting unique cities. There are also "badges" that users can collect by completing certain tasks (such as visiting a certain number of cities, states, etc.).
